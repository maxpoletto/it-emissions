A simple model to estimate and forecast IT- and AI-related emissions at the University of ZÃ¼rich (UZH).

Although many of the default parameter values are specific to UZH, the model should be applicable to other universities (and possibly large corporate campuses).

See doc/paper.tex for a detailed description of methodology and analysis of results.
